  <h4>Arielle Nissenblatt</h4>
  <p>Founder of the Earbuds Podcast Collective, co-creator of the Outlier Podcast Festival, a lover of license plates and roller blading.</p>

    </ul>
  
  <br />


<p>Newsletter editor, event organiser and podcast wonder <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/arielle-nissenblatt">Arielle Nissenblatt</a> joins Mark to discuss an often maligned tuber.</p>

<p>Arielle grew up almost exclusively on potatoes, although she admits her palate has broadened slightly since then. If you ever thought this vegetable (which is not a vegetable, it’s a tuber; we’ve covered this) was boring, prepare to have your mind exploded all the way off.</p>

<p>You’ll also learn some interesting facts about potatoes, so strap in and get ready to carbo-load.</p>

<h3 id="arielles-picks">Arielle’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="hash-brownshttpsenwikipediaorgwikihash_browns"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_browns">Hash browns</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38240beb001c90.jpg" alt="Hash brown" /></p>

<p>Both Arielle and Mark might be getting these and home fries confused, but we’re essentially talking about mashed up bits of potato, fried. Arielle used to have one of these on the bus to school, which proves she won at childhood.</p>

<h4 id="french-frieshttpsenwikipediaorgwikifrench_fries"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fries">French fries</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38240c7b785d50.png" alt="French fries" /></p>

<p>The French fry is, at least for Americans, perhaps potatoes’ default state. Whether long and skinny, short and nubbly, or curly, it’s all good. The least said about sweet potato fries the better, mostly because they’re not potatoes.</p>

<h4 id="samosashttpsenwikipediaorgwikisamosa"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosa">Samosas</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38240cf5110ea0.jpg" alt="Samosas" /></p>

<p>The samosa is more a potato delivery mechanism, but a strong one. Mark is also a fan of the flavour of a curried potato, so it’s a strong showing.</p>

<h4 id="latkeshttpsenwikipediaorgwikilatke"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latke">Latkes</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38240d3daa4320.jpg" alt="Latkes" /></p>

<p>As if hash browns and home fries weren&#8217;t enough, this common Jewish delicacy is another welcome addition to the mashed-up-bits-of-fried-potato roster.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="roasthttpsenwikipediaorgwikisunday_roast"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_roast">Roast</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38240c287e73a0.jpg" alt="Sunday roast" /></p>

<p>The humble roast potato is, believes Mark, a beautiful thing, and who can disagree? It’s hard to beat a fluffy potato filling, surrounded by salt and fat. And if that fat happens to come from a goose, so much the better.</p>

<h4 id="chips">Chips</h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38240c5f39aea0.jpg" alt="Chips" /></p>

<p>Not, under any circumstances to be confused with French fries, chips are an important staple in British cuisine. Mark urges Arielle — and by extension, you the listener — to try and lay hands on a potato scallop, because it’s possible your life may not be the same afterwards.</p>

<h4 id="jacket-potatohttpsenwikipediaorgwikibaked_potato"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baked_potato">Jacket potato</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38240d23654190.jpg" alt="Jacket potato" /></p>

<p>The jacket — or baked — potato is Mark&#8217;s third choice, partially as a delivery mechanism for other flavours, but for Arielle, a delivery mechanism for butter. Rub olive oil and salt into the skin and pop it in the oven for three days. Delicious.</p>

<h4 id="shepherds-piehttpsenwikipediaorgwikishepherd27s_pie"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd%27s_pie">Shepherd’s pie</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38240e4b8c6170.jpg" alt="Shepherd’s pie" /></p>

<p>The mashed potato that serves as the hat for a cottage or shepherd’s pie — Mark preferring the lamb-based option — can be improved by deploying a fork, and sprinkling cheese all over it. Mashed potato didn’t, in its naked form make either list as such, but it’s important that it get a mention, even if it needs a little dressing up.</p>

  <h4>Becky Graham</h4>
  <p>Co-host of the podcast <em>Your Own Words</em>.</p>


    <ul>
      
        <li><a href="https://www.yowpod.com/">Your Own Words</a></li>
      
    </ul>
  
  <br />


<p>Mark is joined by one half of the literary podcast <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yowpod.com/">Your Own Words</a>, voracious reader and Danish furniture fan, <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/becky-graham/">Becky Graham</a>, to swap notes on badass women from the printed page.</p>

<h3 id="a-sincere-apology">A “sincere” apology</h3>

<p>The first discussion topic caused both guest and presenter to embark on a number of attempts at Irish accents. These were not successful, and all parties apologise for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>This episode contains a few naughty words (mostly the same word, but said a lot).</p>

<h3 id="beckys-list">Becky’s list</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="maureen-oharahttpsenwikipediaorgwikimaureen_o27hara"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_O%27Hara">Maureen O’Hara</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined381c0e870b2090.jpg" alt="Maureen O’Hara" />
Becky’s first pick is a Hollywood actor who co-wrote and co-starred in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045061/"><em>The Quiet Man</em></a>, and was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.moviefone.com/2017/11/06/actress-maureen-ohara-calling-out-sexual-harassment-1945/">blacklisted</a> for not sleeping with execs in order to get parts. If you take her at her word — and why wouldn’t you? — she also approached Walt Disney with a view to making <em>Mary Poppins</em> with her in the lead role, a proposition which Disney turned down before apparently going off to make it with Julie Andrews. She also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flightglobal.com/almost-heaven/85495.article">owned a fleet of aircraft</a>, so there’s that.</p>

<h4 id="matilda-wormwoodhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimatilda_wormwood"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_Wormwood">Matilda Wormwood</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined381c0e92afa060.jpg" alt="Matilda Wormwood" />
There’s very little not to like about Matilda, the titular star of Roald Dahl’s children’s story, who taught herself telekinesis and devised ingenious ways to mess with her ignorant family members.</p>

<h4 id="miss-marplehttpsenwikipediaorgwikimiss_marple"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Marple">Miss Marple</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined381c0e9d2feb80.jpg" alt="Miss Marple" />
Not unlike one of Mark&#8217;s picks, Marple plays up to others’ perceptions of her as being a doddery old woman, but her keen intellect and self-assuredness invariably wins the day.</p>

<h4 id="lucy-pevensiehttpsenwikipediaorgwikilucy_pevensie"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Pevensie">Lucy Pevensie</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined381c0ea524f7e0.jpg" alt="Lucy Pevensie" />
The youngest sibling of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia"><em>Chronicles of Narnia</em></a> family is a favourite of Becky’s because of her bravery, kindness, and her unwillingness to be shoved aside.</p>

<h4 id="elizabeth-bennethttpsenwikipediaorgwikielizabeth_bennet"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth Bennet</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined381c0eadc4ea40.jpg" alt="Elizabeth Bennet" />
The protagonist of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice"><em>Pride and Prejudice</em></a> married for love and not for status, and didn’t allow other people to make decisions for her. For Becky, she’s an example of knowing who you are and what you want, which was a rare thing to read as a women in the 19th century, much less to write.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="lisbeth-salanderhttpsenwikipediaorgwikilisbeth_salander"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbeth_Salander">Lisbeth Salander</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined381c0e8c6d2600.jpg" alt="Lisbeth Salander" />
Mark’s first pick is a badass with a motorbike, a photographic memory and a head full of code. He was introduced to her via <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo"><em>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</em></a>, and quickly identified with this woman who opted out of social convention but is guided by a strong sense of justice, which she meats out without remorselessly.</p>

<h4 id="granny-weatherwaxhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigranny_weatherwax"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_Weatherwax">Granny Weatherwax</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined381c0e97a109b0.jpg" alt="Granny Weatherwax" />
The straight woman in the Discworld double-act that is Weatherwax and Ogg, she is the kind of woman who “has no truck” with things. She also has a mean poker face.</p>

<p>_Artwork by  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SlowhandManjam/">SlowhandManjam</a> _</p>

<h4 id="arya-starkhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiarya_stark"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arya_Stark">Arya Stark</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined381c0ea18b5660.jpg" alt="Arya Stark" />
One of only a handful of female characters within the <em>Game of Thrones</em> universe with any degree of agency, Arya fights against the perceptions of her gender, and then fights anyone else that’ll take her on.</p>

<h4 id="clarice-starlinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiclarice_starling"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarice_Starling">Clarice Starling</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined381c0ea9bb6ff0.jpg" alt="Clarice Starling" />
The lead character in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_(novel)"><em>The Silence of the Lambs</em></a> makes Mark’s list as a solid, powerful, human character. Her story is less about surviving in a man’s world, and more about getting the job done and catching the bad guys.</p>

<h4 id="zoey-ashehttpsfuturistic-violence-and-fancy-suitsfandomcomwikizoey_ashe"><a target="_blank" href="https://futuristic-violence-and-fancy-suits.fandom.com/wiki/Zoey_Ashe">Zoey Ashe</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined381c0eb32df490.jpg" alt="Zoey Ashe" />
Mark’s final pick is the protagonist from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wong_(writer)">David Wong</a>’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20501606-futuristic-violence-and-fancy-suits"><em>Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits</em></a>, a snarky young woman with a cat called Stink Machine and no time for any of this bullshit.</p>

<p>Writer and podcaster Sara-Mae Tuson kicks off a double-bill of brilliant women in literature. This week, Mark and Sara-Mae discuss under-appreciated female authors.</p>

<p>Sara-Mae is a writer who’s turned her natural storytelling abilities into podcasting magic. Her previous work, <a target="_blank" href="https://fablegazers.libsyn.com/">The Sugar Baby Confessionals</a> picked won bronze in the Best Sex and Relationship Podcast at the 2019 British Podcast Awards, and she’s now working on a series all about the life and work of her first pick.</p>

<p>Mark and Sara-Mae discuss the value of being talked up to in literature, the perception of romance in literature, and the industry’s apparent reliance on classifying work, and putting authors and their work in boxes.</p>

<p>Here’s <a target="_blank" href="https://theoutpost.fm/yow/8/">Mark’s appearance on <em>Your Own Words</em></a>, in which he talked about <em>Grinny</em> by Nicholas Fisk, and a little about Gene Kemp.</p>

<h3 id="sara-maes-picks">Sara-Mae’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="georgette-heyerhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigeorgette_heyer"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgette_Heyer">Georgette Heyer</a></h4>

<p>Sara-Mae is a fan of the often looked-down-upon genre of regency romance, and considers Heyer to be the gold standard. This Wimbledon-born woman wrote not only romances, but thrillers, with over 50 novels to her name.</p>

<h4 id="elizabeth-von-arnimhttpsenwikipediaorgwikielizabeth_von_arnim"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_von_Arnim">Elizabeth von Arnim</a></h4>

<p>Von Arnim makes Sara-Mae’s list thanks to the elegence and insightfulness of her work. She wrote from the late 19th to the early 20th century, was a modern thinker, and at one time the breadwinner.</p>

<h4 id="mary-stewarthttpsenwikipediaorgwikimary_stewart_novelist"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Stewart_(novelist)">Mary Stewart</a></h4>

<p>Sara-Mae picked this 20th century thriller and romance novelist for her vivid writing, her scene-setting, and her ability to place ordinary people into difficult situations, allowing them to do extraordinary things. </p>

<h4 id="barbara-pymhttpsenwikipediaorgwikibarbara_pym"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Pym">Barbara Pym</a></h4>

<p>Sara-Mae’s next pick is described as &#8220;forever being forgotten, and forever revived”. Another author who derived meaning from the ordinary, Pym was once described as the most underrated writer of the century.</p>

<h4 id="cynthia-voigthttpsenwikipediaorgwikicynthia_voigt"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Voigt">Cynthia Voigt</a></h4>

<p>Voigt’s book <em>The Runner</em> was an eye-opener for Sara-Mae, as it gave her permission to worry less about conforming to society’s expectations. </p>

<h4 id="nancy-mitfordhttpsenwikipediaorgwikinancy_mitford"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Mitford">Nancy Mitford</a></h4>

<p>“Nancy the novelist” was a joint fifth pick for Sara-Mae, who wonders how much her writing would have been informed and affected by her life and her other (in)famous sisters.</p>

<h3 id="marks-pick">Mark’s pick</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="victoria-woodhttpsenwikipediaorgwikivictoria_wood"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Wood">Victoria Wood</a></h4>

<p>Mark picked Wood as his first selection, as her writing work can sometimes go unappreciated. As well as an accomplished songwriter and musician, Wood was a highly successful standup, and through <em>Acorn Antiques</em>, <em>Dinner Ladies</em> and the mockumentaries in <em>As Seen on TV</em>, has created enduring comic characters.</p>

<h4 id="nicole-perlmanhttpsenwikipediaorgwikinicole_perlman"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Perlman">Nicole Perlman</a></h4>

<p>Mark’s second pick is a co-writer of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, <em>Captain Marvel</em> and <em>Detective Pikachu</em>. As a comic book screenwriter, her name isn’t usually up in lights, hence her addition to Mark’s list.</p>

<h4 id="gene-kemphttpsenwikipediaorgwikigene_kemp"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kemp">Gene Kemp</a></h4>

<p>Mark picked this children’s and young-adult writer as a name he fondly remembered from his past, even if he seemed to be unable to recall any of her actual books. Kemp wrote about everyday characters living mundane lives, but brought out the drama through their inner monologues.</p>

<h4 id="abi-morganhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiabi_morgan"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abi_Morgan">Abi Morgan</a></h4>

<p>The creator of the TV show <em>The Hour</em>, and screenwriter for <em>The Iron Lady</em> is Mark’s fourth pick as a writer whose work many of us have enjoyed, especially within the UK, but that we don’t necessarily always attribute to the correct source.</p>

<h4 id="tamora-piercehttpsenwikipediaorgwikitamora_pierce"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamora_Pierce">Tamora Pierce</a></h4>

<p>Mark delves further back into his childhood for his final pick, choosing to highlight Tamora Pierce and her <em>Wild Magic</em> book series.</p>

<h3 id="more-of-sara-mae">More of Sara-Mae</h3>

<p>You can find Sara-Mae’s podcast work under the <a target="_blank" href="https://fablegazers.wordpress.com/">Fable Gazers</a> banner. Her current series is <a target="_blank" href="https://heyertoday.libsyn.com">Heyer Today</a>, tracks the life and work of Georgette Heyer.</p>

<p>Ben is the co-host of the <a target="_blank" href="http://eurowhat.com/">EuroWhat? podcast</a> with previous guest <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/mike-mccomb/">Mike McComb</a>, and hailing from the same state as Mystery Science Theater 3000 has a keen eye for a film that’s so bad it’s good. But that’s not all the Cannon studio had to offer; some of the work is surprisingly meaningful, if buried under piles of rubble caused by explosions set off by breakdancing ninjas.</p>

<h3 id="spoiler-alert">Spoiler alert</h3>

<p>Mark especially is quite liberal with the spoiler sauce in this episode, so if you plan on watching any of these films, just be warned that the element of surprise — at least in terms of plot — might be diminished.</p>

<h3 id="bens-picks">Ben’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="the-applehttpswwwimdbcomtitlett0080380"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080380/">The Apple</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38135b7ce06870.jpg" alt="The Apple" />
Also known as <em>Star Rock</em> for some reason, <em>The Apple</em> is a 1980 film telling the story of a global Eurovision competition equivalent. It’s a musical turned up to 11.</p>

<h4 id="breakinhttpswwwimdbcomtitlett0086998"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086998/">Breakin’</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38135b80986760.jpg" alt="Breakin’" />
The film that spawned a thousand spoof sequel titles (yes, this <em>is</em> the one that had the sequel called <em>Electric Boogaloo</em>), <em>Breakin’</em>, from 1984, is the “save the rec center” story told through the medium of breakdancing.</p>

<h4 id="ninja-iii-the-dominationhttpswwwimdbcomtitlett0087805"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087805/">Ninja III: The Domination</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38135b8471f810.jpg" alt="Ninja III: The Domination" />
This time, the ninja is a woman! In 1984’s <em>Ninja III</em>, the main character is possessed by the spirit of a fallen ninja who must seek to regain his/her honour, sometimes on a golf course.</p>

<h4 id="invasion-usahttpswwwimdbcomtitlett0089348"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089348/">Invasion USA</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38135b87e9b9b0.jpg" alt="Invasion USA" />
This Chuck Norris vehicl<img src="invasion_usa_Black_2D_1400x.jpg" alt="" />e from 1985 is essentially why we have Chuck Norris jokes. With <em>Invasion USA</em>, Norris was able to make the jump from karate star to full-on action star. If you only see one movie that destroys a mall in Atlanta this year, make it this one.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="lifeforcehttpswwwimdbcomtitlett0089489"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089489/">Lifeforce</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38135b8e27ee50.png" alt="Lifeforce" />
Mark’s top pick, from 1985, also makes Ben’s list. The film has a good pedigree in both its writer and director, and is a Anglo-American collaboration based on a novel. But perhaps it was the bonkers premise that means it’s been relegated to something close to B-movie status.</p>

<h4 id="house-of-the-long-shadowshttpswwwimdbcomtitlett0085693"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085693/">House of the Long Shadows</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38135b92487310.jpg" alt="House of the Long Shadows" />
This tongue-in-cheek horror from 1983 is a who’s who of British stars from scary movie days of yore. It’s also set in Wales, so that’s nice.</p>

<h4 id="runaway-trainhttpswwwimdbcomtitlett0089941"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089941/">Runaway Train</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38135b953273a0.jpg" alt="Runaway Train" />
This Jon Voight number from 1985 was based on an Akira Kurosawa film that never got off the ground. It’s a tense prison escape movie that turns into an action suspense story with the kind of heroic ending you just don’t see anymore.</p>

<h4 id="barflyhttpswwwimdbcomtitlett0092618"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092618/">Barfly</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined38135b98352c50.jpg" alt="Barfly" />
1987’s <em>Barfly</em> stars Mickey Rourke as a smart writer whose only real ambition is to make enough money from his work to buy the next round. It’s a rare departure into considered drama, for the studio.</p>

  <p>Mike has been writing about TV online since 2008, when he started the blog WTF Little House on the Prairie? The blog was a project to practice writing about television analytically prior to getting an MA in Television-Radio-Film from Syracuse University, or as he likes to call it &#8220;TV Camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>TV writer <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/mike-mccomb/">Mike McComb</a> joins Mark to discuss the bizarre and beautiful magic of this European musical tradition. Enjoy this episode, and don’t forget to have a drink on Terry in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4pCQsQsMstPMltpVQ3lRHPN/during-song-number-nine-this-year-ill-be-encouraging-everyone-to-raise-a-glass-graham-norton">song 9</a>.</p>

<p>Mike is a Eurovision aficionado, having come to it via the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounds_Like_Teen_Spirit">Sounds Like Teen Spirit</a> documentary. He’s not let being American and thus being geofenced out of most live broadcasts steer him away, as his work on the <a target="_blank" href="http://eurovision.whatelseison.tv/">EuroWhat? podcast</a> will attest.</p>

<h3 id="mikes-picks">Mike’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="stockholm-2016httpsenwikipediaorgwikieurovision_song_contest_2016"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2016">Stockholm, 2016</a></h4>

<p>Both Mark and Mike felt that this year’s ceremony was the epitome of everything that’s wonderful about Eurovision, especially the sense of humour.</p>

<h4 id="copenhagen-2014httpsenwikipediaorgwikieurovision_song_contest_2014"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2014">Copenhagen, 2014</a></h4>

<p>This was Mike’s second pick as it was an iconic year for the contest, seeing Austria’s Conchita Wurst absolutely nail it, and bringing us more memorable and mockable Eurovision moments.</p>

<h4 id="baku-2012httpsenwikipediaorgwikieurovision_song_contest_2012"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2012">Baku, 2012</a></h4>

<p>Mike appreciated this final from a European education perspective. It gave us the singing grannies, delightfully clunky hosts, and a consistent fan favourite in <em>Euphoria</em>, which was another winning song for Sweden.</p>

<h4 id="malmo-2013httpsenwikipediaorgwikieurovision_song_contest_2013"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2013">Malmö, 2013</a></h4>

<p>This was a surprise entry for Mike, but it snuck in as it was simply a solid year.  The opening reintroduced the Parade of Nations, but perhaps the year was marred by a little too much dubstep.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="dusseldorf-2011httpsenwikipediaorgwikieurovision_song_contest_2011"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2011">Düsseldorf, 2011</a></h4>

<p>Mark enjoyed the high level of earnestness from this year&#8217;s final, the host’s entertainment appeal, and the songs. For Mike, there was a consistency issue throughout the night, with all the favourites finishing in the first half.</p>

<h4 id="tel-aviv-2019httpsenwikipediaorgwikieurovision_song_contest_2019"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2019">Tel Aviv, 2019</a></h4>

<p>Mark picked the 2019 final for its focus on interesting staging, and because he felt they didn’t try to go overboard with the showbiz sparkle, but instead were quite humble and sweet in places. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTb69WkBbvs">Iceland’s entry</a> was legit terrifying, though.</p>

<h4 id="oslo-2010httpsenwikipediaorgwikieurovision_song_contest_2010"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2010">Oslo, 2010</a></h4>

<p>Mark thought 2010 was a nice year, and felt it marked the beginning of a transition into the knowing, semi-ironically-detached period the content is now in. It was the first contest where Mike got fully invested, so it has a special place in his heart, too.</p>

    <description>Mark gets wobbly-wobbly and timey-wimey with tech YouTuber George Chachanidze.

The pair started by discussing their favourite incarnations of the Doctor, and then their favourite — or least favourite — companions.

Spoilers abound

If you’re not caught up with Doctor Whoand you intend to, be warned that Mark and George will spoil the hell out of it for you.

Honourable mentions


The Family of Blood
Kerblam!
The Empty Child
The Eleventh Hour
Mummy on the Orient Express


George’s picks

In order of discussion:

Heaven Sent (S09E11; Peter Capaldi)

This highly dramatic and Groundhog Day reminiscent episode takes place shortly after the death of the Doctor’s companion Clara, and is pretty much entirely a monologue. The names of the two episodes got mixed up in the recording: Heaven Sent (the one Make and George both like) is the first in a two-parter that concludes with Hell Bent (which George does not like, and Mark couldn’t remember).

Blink (S03E10; David Tennant, Freema Agyeman)

Blink is regarded by many Whovians as the best of the revival. It introduces the Weeping Angels, who are older than the universe, and zap you back in time to feed off the energy displaced by the life you would have led. Or something.

Midnight (S04E10; David Tennant, Catherine Tate)

Another Doctor-heavy episode, this takes place on the planet of Midnight, which is made entirely of diamonds. It has a horror movie feel, but is almost a bottle episode (in as much as bottle episodes are often made out of a necessity to keep an eye on the budget.)

Silence in the Library / Forest of the Dead (S04E08-9; David Tennant, Catherine Tate)

This two-parter introduces space archeologist River Song, who would be an important recurring character across multiple Doctor incarnations. It also introduces the Vashta Nerada, a species of space piranha 

Dalek (S01E06; Christopher Eccleston, Billie Piper)

This episode reintroduces the Daleks in a Utah bunker filled with alien bric-à-brac. It brought them back defeated and weakened, which laid the groundwork for a new generation to be terrified by them all over again.

Mark’s picks

In order of discussion:

Father’s Day (S01E08; Christopher Eccleston, Billie Piper)

This episode came early on in the reboot's run, and takes place in 1987, wherein Rose saves her dad from being hit by a car, only to unleash a squadron of time-devouring pterodactyls called reapers.

The Beast Below (S05E02; Matt Smith, Karen Gillan)

This steampunk episode takes place on Starship UK, which carries England, Northern Ireland and Wales — but not Scotland — on the back of a giant space whale, who is kept in perpetual agony to ensure it keeps moving. The finale of the episode see the Doctor’s companion Amy realise that the whale would’ve carried the citizens regardless, because it couldn’t stand to see the children cry.

The Impossible Planet / The Satan Pit (S02E08-9; David Tennant, Billie Piper)

This two-parter takes place on a planet that we believe to be Hell, and where the villain is the actual devil. It introduced the Ood, and wasn’t afraid to make religious points (given that this is a show for children).

World Enough and Time (S10E11; Peter Capaldi, Pearl Mackie, Matt Lucas)

The first in a two-parter that sees Bill become a Cyberman, Mark picked this for very specific reasons.

<p>The Christmas season begins with Mark talking to <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/daz-wright/">Daz Wright</a> of Moselele, about the best songs to ring in the festivities.</p>

<p>Daz is a musician, and a founder-member of the Birmingham-based ukulele group Moselele. He’s also a big fan of Christmas, and delivered a sack full of joy to the List Envy studio, along with an honest-to-goodness Christmas cracker and actual sleigh bells.</p>

<h3 id="whamageddon">Whamageddon</h3>

<p>The pair discuss this real-world survival game. Like many pure things, Whamageddon has been co-opted by the corporate world, so we’ll stick with the original rules rather than those imposed by the Bauer Media corporation, who have attempted to make it their thing recently.</p>

<ul>
<li>The object is to go as long as possible without hearing the original version of Wham!’s song <em>Last Christmas</em> (you won’t hear that version in this episode, so you’re safe).</li>
<li>It runs from Dec 1st until Christmas eve.</li>
<li>As soon as you recognise the song, that’s it, you’re out, and play resumes for you next year.</li>
<li>If you’re deliberately sabotaged, bad luck, but that’s not the spirit of the game. You’re still out, but the saboteur is a dick.</li>

<h3 id="dazs-picks">Daz’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="slade-merry-xmas-everybodyhttpssonglinkgbi1446947247"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/1446947247">Slade — Merry Xmas Everybody</a></h4>

<p>This is, for Daz, a perfect Christmas song, as it falls into one of the main categories: nostalgia, a description of the Christmas day or event, and a shameless emotional trigger… and perhaps it embodies all three.</p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/i/403730186">Oasis cover</a> Mark refers to was not done for the BBC’s Live Lounge series, but for the NME in a joint venture with the War Child charity.</p>

<h4 id="elton-john-step-into-christmashttpssonglinkgbi1440912990"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/1440912990">Elton John — Step into Christmas</a></h4>

<p>A late addition to Daz&#8217;s list, <em>Step into Christmas</em> is nothing if not meta, opening with the line “welcome to my Christmas song”. Daz calls it shameless, but you can be the judge.</p>

<h4 id="wham-last-christmashttpssonglinkgbi1041805087"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/1041805087">Wham! — Last Christmas</a></h4>

<p>You were promised that your ears would remain a Wham!-free zone, so the demonstrative track for this segment is brought to you by courtesy of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XR0EZ0oHwSV2XhhShzX5A">Crazy Frog</a> (who still has 6.5 million YouTube subscribers). Daz enjoys that <em>Last Christmas</em> embodies the spirit of the day (as per his third category of Christmas song success).</p>

<h4 id="mariah-carey-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-youhttpssonglinkgbi585972803"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/585972803">Mariah Carey — All I Want for Christmas is You</a></h4>

<p>Despite Daz describing Mariah&#8217;s vocal opening as “warbling nonsense”, he enjoys the chunka-chunka piano that follows… and frankly, who doesn’t? This easily satisfies the “emotional trigger” item of Daz’s Christmas song checklist, and who among us doesn’t want to be wholly owned by a quasi-religious semi-fictional wizard?</p>

<h4 id="the-weather-girls-dear-santa-bring-me-a-man-this-christmas-part-1httpssonglinkgbi1041805885"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/1041805885">The Weather Girls &#8211; Dear Santa, Bring Me a Man this Christmas (Part 1)</a></h4>

<p>Following on from, and largely borrowing from the success of <em>It’s Raining Men</em>, <em>Dear Santa, Bring Me a Man this Christmas (Part 1)</em> is pretty much the same song, but festive. If you haven’t watched the video, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko3yBFoTm5c">now’s your chance</a>.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="greg-lake-i-believe-in-father-christmashttpssonglinkgbi1309165544"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/1309165544">Greg Lake — I Believe in Father Christmas</a></h4>

<p>Mark enjoys this quiet and conemplative ballad, that Daz describes as one of the more musically interesting festive offerings. But sadly, the line “the Christmas we get, we deserve” was not enough to make it Christmas #1, which ended up that year being Queen.</p>

<h4 id="the-waitresses-christmas-wrappinghttpssonglinkgbi1442539026"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/1442539026">The Waitresses — Christmas Wrapping</a></h4>

<p>Mark feels there is a &#8220;Dickens quality” to this story song (to be fair, it does start with the line “Bah humbug”), about loneliness and romance, leading to a joyful and merry Christmas day.</p>

<h4 id="the-pogues-amp-kirsty-maccoll-fairytale-of-new-yorkhttpssonglinkgbi52576042"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/52576042">The Pogues &amp; Kirsty MacColl — Fairytale of New York</a></h4>

<p>Anyone who’s offended by the lyrics towards the end of this song has our axe, and there’s an argument to be had around the specific meaning of the word in that time and context, but for now, let’s focus on the fact that it’s a winter banger, and a wonderful piece of Christmas melancholia.</p>

<h4 id="johnny-mathis-when-a-child-is-bornhttpssonglinkgbi201419169"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/201419169">Johnny Mathis — When a Child is Born</a></h4>

<p>It took eight songs before the pair got to one that actually described the li’l baby Jesus, but here we are. It’s.a crooner’s song, and pretty sappy, but it does fall squarely in that mid-70s bracket that seems to categorise Christmas songs.</p>

<h4 id="tom-jones-amp-cerys-matthews-baby-its-cold-outsidehttpssonglinkgbi1440715545"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/1440715545">Tom Jones &amp; Cerys Matthews - Baby It’s Cold Outside</a></h4>

<p>If you’re offended by any of the lyrics in this song, you’re a child and you don’t know what grown-up words mean (sometimes two consenting adults can do something naughty and that’s OK). Mark gravely prefers the cover over the original as he believes it packs more personality and fun.</p>

<h3 id="jons-picks">Jon’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="kevin-smith-movieshttpsenwikipediaorgwikikevin_smith_filmography"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Smith_filmography">Kevin Smith movies</a></h4>

<p>The director-turned-podcaster Kevin Smith sidled onto VHS screens in the early 90s with films like /Clerks/ and /Mallrats/. He made them for a specific generation, but now they’re all grown up, is it time to leave those films behind, or is it enough to just not get excited about new ones?</p>

<h4 id="the-pop-charts">The pop charts</h4>

<p>Jon picked the pop music countdown as his second item, possibly in an effort to dump pop before pop could dump him. Nevertheless, it has become something of a cultural oddity in the era of streaming everything, so can we safely leave the pop charts behind? And what’s to be done about the Christmas single?</p>

<h4 id="graham-linehanhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigraham_linehan"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Linehan">Graham Linehan</a></h4>

<p>Linehan co-created two iconic sitcoms for Channel Four in the UK, but his recent history has been marred by unpleasant online behaviour. But the work stands, and on this Mark and Jon hold firm.</p>

<h4 id="the-cheeky-nandos">The Cheeky Nando’s</h4>

<p>Who doesn’t love a nice bit of chicken and chips? And why must the idea of fast casual dining be a joke among snooty older people? These are the questions that need answering, but thankfully, Jon is on the case…. to ask them, if not to come up with a concrete answer.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="smash-mouthhttpsenwikipediaorgwikismash_mouth"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smash_Mouth">Smash Mouth</a></h4>

<p>In the late 90s, you couldn’t turn on a radio or seemingly watch a film without hearing a large man shout “SOME!” at you. Yes, /Allstar/ was a big hit, but by remaining consistent in its output, is the band serving its audience or allowing them to move on without them?</p>

<h4 id="bill-hickshttpsenwikipediaorgwikibill_hicks"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hicks">Bill Hicks</a></h4>

<p>Bill Hicks was a hero to most (in their late 30s to mid 40s)., but he never meant shit to millennials. For so many, his work was a cultural touchstone whose effects ripped throughout comedy. He was also a misogynist and a cultural snob, so perhaps it’s time to let him rock out on the lake of fire in his by himself.</p>

<h4 id="american-beautyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiamerican_beauty_1999_film"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Beauty_(1999_film)">American Beauty</a></h4>

<p>This Mendes -directed, Spacey vehicle was a firm favourite of the late-teenage Mark, but even without the lead actor’s stain, it’s a pretty marred picture by today’s standards.</p>

<h4 id="the-chip-on-his-shoulder">The chip on his shoulder</h4>

<p>This is something that may appeal to many, and is worth taking a listen to, as it probably doesn’t translate all that well in text.</p>

<p>Everyone can stand to be a little bit more banana, so this week’s guest is professional clown, public speaker and banana enthusiast, <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/emma-stroud/">Emma Stroud</a>.</p>

<p>Emma’s personal day of relevation &#8211; perhaps not dissimilar to Albert Hofmann’s bicycle day, as covered in <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/e/top-5-journeys-to-scientific-discovery-379c511ff180a6/">our first episode</a> — came about when Emma realised how transformative she found the act of dressing up at a grown-up function, not like a fancy duchess, but like a banana.</p>

<p>Emma believes part of her purpose is, not only to help people laugh, but to encourage them to think more as a result. But that’s not where the healing ends: the pair uncover a way to save yourself from embarrassment at the hands of a mushy apple, and Mark asks Emma if she’s ever eaten a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morinda_citrifolia">noni</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kiwi</li>
<li>Pomegranate</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="emmas-picks">Emma’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="banana">Banana</h4>

<p>Apart from the fact that it did lead Emma to deliver a TED talk dressed as one, it’s a fruit that rarely disappoints, and has a handy traffic light system to let you know when it’s OK to eat one, depending no your personal preference.</p>

<h4 id="orange">Orange</h4>

<p>This fruit that positively begs to be shared is also the name of Emma’s clown persona. It’s the orange. We’ve all had one. Orange. Go on, have one now, you won’t be disappointed. The orange. Orange.</p>

<h4 id="grape">Grape</h4>

<p>The grape is an all-day fruit, and is never not available. You can take them to people who are ill in hospital — for some reason — or you can cut them in two to really change up how your day is going. You can also freeze them and pretend you’ve got sweets.</p>

<h4 id="strawberry">Strawberry</h4>

<p>Nothing goes with cream, or even ice cream, quite like a strawberry. Plus, it’s the only fruit that you are legally allowed to steal from anyone’s farm because it’s not a criminal offence: it’s scrumping. (Just make sure you have a basket with you and also don’t hold us responsible if you get caught with red all down your face.)</p>

<h4 id="blueberry">Blueberry</h4>

<p>This superfood is a solid-performing team player of a fruit. They’re versatile, very good for you, and often overlooked.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="avocado">Avocado</h4>

<p>Mark only began to truly understand the power of the avocado in early 2019, and like all converts, has now become a zealot. </p>

<h4 id="pear">Pear</h4>

<p>Mark has been known to grind up the bottom seedy bits of a pear in an effort to avoid walking to the bin, and if someone handed you a pear right now, you’d probably kiss them (unless it’s outside their brief window of acceptable ripeness).</p>

<h4 id="apple">Apple</h4>

<p>Mark favours the braeburn for its consistency and delivering a satisfying, sweet crunch. It’s perhaps not the star of the show, but is the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk">Virgil van Dijk</a> of the fruit bowl.</p>

<h4 id="olive">Olive</h4>

<p>It’s possible Mark might just have put this in to wind Emma up, but it is an actual fruit.</p>

<h4 id="cherry-tomato">Cherry tomato</h4>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Guest</h3>

  <img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/guests/37e55f028ebff0.jpg">
  <h4>Dr Sophie Carr</h4>
  <p>World’s most interesting mathematician and #Queenof Statistics winner. Owner of Bays Consulting. Loves Bayesian statistics.</p>


    <ul>
      
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/sophiebays/">Dr Sophie Carr (@SophieBays) | Twitter</a></li>
      
        <li><a href="http://www.baysconsulting.co.uk">Bays Consulting &amp;#8211; Operational and Mathematical Analysis</a></li>
      
    </ul>
  
  <br />


<p>Mark gets mathematical with bayesian mathematician <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/sophie-carr/">Sophie Carr</a>.</p>

<p>Sophie describes herself as an “accidental mathematician&#8221;, getting into the subject after studying to be an engineer. She got her PhD on the job, and transitioned from fluid mechanics to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayesian statistics</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the piping speech from <em>Patriot</em> Mark mentioned.</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-9Rfrui9A</p>

<h3 id="sophies-picks">Sophie’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="turbo-codehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiturbo_code"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_code">Turbo Code</a></h4>

<p>Invented by telephone engineer Claude Berrou, this bayesian algorithm encodes information for use in phone calls, and has laid the way for technology like 3G and 4G, a couple of decades in advance.</p>

<h4 id="universal-unique-identifier-uuidhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiuniversally_unique_identifier"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Universal unique identifier (UUID)</a></h4>

<p>UUIDS — sometimes galled GUIDs — are collections of numbers and letters that can be generated by independent machines, and be almost guaranteed to be entirely unique. They’re based on timestamps — a number of seconds since a given period — and some info about the computer creating the code, as well as some random bits.</p>

<h4 id="pagerankhttpsenwikipediaorgwikipagerank"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a></h4>

<p>Named after Google co-founder Larry Page, the PageRank algorithm ranks web pages based on links, the assumption being that the more important a website is, the more people will link to it.</p>

<h4 id="proportional-integral-derivative-controlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikipid_controller"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">Proportional integral derivative control</a></h4>

<p>A PID controller corrects problems with automated processes. The best example, and why Sophie added it to her list, is ABS (automatic breaking in a car).</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="lz-77-compressionhttpsenwikipediaorgwikilz77_and_lz78"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78">LZ 77 compression</a></h4>

<p>This simple form of text compression is Mark&#8217;s top pick because it forms part of the Zip archive format, which is something even non-technical people are familiar with, and have used for decades. It works by dropping markers to repeated characters within a file, so you could reduce the phrase “how now brown cow” to “h① n① br①n c①” (a reduction of around 20%).</p>

<h4 id="rsahttpsenwikipediaorgwikirsa_cryptosystem"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a></h4>

<p>Public key — or asymmetric — cryptography allows for information to be encrypted by one party, but only readable by the other party. That works because the party that wants to receive the information makes their public key available to anyone who wants it, and then those that want to send information, use that public key to encrypt it. However the information can only be decrypted by that first person using their <em>private key</em>.</p>

<h4 id="proof-of-workhttpsenbitcoinitwikiproof_of_work"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work">Proof of Work</a></h4>

<p>This algorithm is central to the block chain &#8211; which is what bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on, but is also how it’s possible to maintain a shared ledger to reliably keep track of information, and to keep people honest.</p>

<h4 id="reinforcement-learninghttpsenwikipediaorgwikireinforcement_learning"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">Reinforcement learning</a></h4>

<p>This machine learning algorithm made it onto MArk&#8217;s list basically because it’s nice. It reinforces what a computer has learned — hence the name — by giving it a reward; it’s the computer’s job to maximise the time-to-reward ratio, so will figure out ways to solve the problem more efficiently to get that sweet, sweet reward.</p>

<h4 id="dynamic-range-compressionhttpsenwikipediaorgwikidynamic_range_compression"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression">Dynamic range compression</a></h4>

<p>Mark uses this audio compression algorithm in his work as a podcast producer. Essentially it replicates the job of a human, turning the volume of a speaker or an instrument so that the quiet parts are audible, but the loud parts don’t blow your ears off.</p>

<p>Mark and his guest <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/jamie-garner/">Jamie Garner</a> have snuck out of bed, crept downstairs and turned on the telly for a channel-hop through ‘90s nostalgia.</p>

<p>Both Mark and Jamie grew up with Saturday morning programming from the BBC, including <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Live!">/Going Live!/</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_%26_Kicking">/Live &amp; Kicking/</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Up_Doc%3F_(TV_series)"><em>What’s Up Doc?</em></a>, which showed cartoons and showcased some of the UK’s newest pop acts.</p>

<p>Mark does not pass up the opportunity to discuss the kids’ presenter Andy Crane, and the fact that he narrated one of his favourite children’s books. Incidentally, you can hear more about that book and MArk’s thoughts on it — and Andy Crane — on <a target="_blank" href="https://2019.theoutpost.fm/yow/8/">a recent episode of /Your Own Words/</a>.</p>

<h3 id="jamies-picks">Jamie’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="dungeons-amp-dragonshttpsenwikipediaorgwikidungeons_26_dragons_tv_series"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_(TV_series)">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37dfaa9ddd5a90.jpg" alt="Dungeons &amp; Dragons" /></p>

<p>Jamie’s first pick is a repeat-viewing for him. It was first released in 1983, but made its way to the UK some years later. Hollywood has tried to adapt it into cinematic form, but it’s never really taken, however there is quite an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC9-bfsNne8&amp;feature=youtu.be">epic car commercial from Brazil</a>, which is a must-watch for D&amp;D cartoon fans.</p>

<h4 id="thundercatshttpsenwikipediaorgwikithundercats_1985_tv_series"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThunderCats_(1985_TV_series)">ThunderCats</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37dfaaa41eea90.jpg" alt="ThunderCats" /></p>

<p>Every boy of a certain age had at least one <em>ThunderCats</em> toy. It featured a host of memorable characters, and the next piece of action was only a smash-cut away. And in keeping with the tradition of the American Saturday morning cartoon, each episode came with a moral. Remember kids, real winners don’t cry in the bath.</p>

<h4 id="spider-man-and-his-amazing-friendshttpsenwikipediaorgwikispider-man_and_his_amazing_friends"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_and_His_Amazing_Friends">Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37dfaaa79b1900.jpg" alt="Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends" /></p>

<p>This Stan Lee narrated cartoon included Dracula, Frankenstein, the Green Goblin, the Incredible Hulk, and many more. Jamie’s now bringing up his kids to enjoy the series, but he maintains that their favourite character choices are incorrect.</p>

<h4 id="x-men-the-animated-serieshttpsenwikipediaorgwikix-men_tv_series"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(TV_series)">X-Men: The Animated Series</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37dfaaaaceccc0.jpg" alt="X-Men: The Animated Series" /></p>

<p>This show ran for 5 s[image:(null)/(null)]easons, and was[image:(null)/(null)] picked up by Sky in the UK. It brought the comic books to life, transferring the most iconic characters from page to screen</p>

<h4 id="batman-the-animated-serieshttpsenwikipediaorgwikibatman_the_animated_series"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Animated_Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37dfaaadc158d0.jpg" alt="Batman: The Animated Series" /></p>

<p>Starring Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamil as the Joker (roles the pair still portray in video game form), this dark and violent animated series holds up to adult viewing.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="danger-mousehttpsenwikipediaorgwikidanger_mouse_1981_tv_series"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Mouse_(1981_TV_series)">Danger Mouse</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37dfaab46e54d0.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This ITV show started life in 1981, and was rebooted by the BBC a few years back. The original starred David Jason in a number of voices, and is part of a shared cartoon universe (which may be covered in a future pick).</p>

<h4 id="animaniacshttpsenwikipediaorgwikianimaniacs"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37dfaab83065e0.jpg" alt="Animaniacs" /></p>

<p>Mark maintains that this Warner Bros show had no business being made for children. It was anarchic, but the jokes were pitched so far over kids’ heads, it’s a wonder they managed even the five seasons they were commissioned for. For proof, here’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uWW&#8211;w4SRs">Pinky and the Brain making fun</a> of a bad-tempered <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol5RpDEzLzY">Orson Wells recording an ad about frozen peas</a>.</p>

<h4 id="ox-taleshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiox_tales"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox_Tales">Ox Tales</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37dfaabb88b8a0.jpg" alt="Ox Tales" /></p>

<p>This Japanese cartoon captured Mark&#8217;s heart, even though he’d not seen that many episodes. It’s largely been lost to history, but bits are still available on YouTube. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWTX0_Wz4xM">Here’s the opening sequence</a>.</p>

<h4 id="count-duckulahttpsenwikipediaorgwikicount_duckula"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Duckula">Count Duckula</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37dfaabf54b4c0.png" alt="Count Duckula" /></p>

<p>As the theme song described, Duckula would bite neither beast nor man, because he was a vegetarian. It was another outing for Cosgrove &amp; Hall, the writer-creators of <em>Danger Mouse</em> and other shows of that ilk.</p>

<h3 id="bens-picks">Ben’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="xenomorphhttpsenwikipediaorgwikialien_creature_in_alien_franchise"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(creature_in_Alien_franchise)">Xenomorph</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37db07b67522b0.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Known more commonly as “the alien from <em>Alien(s)</em>”, the Xenomorph or internecivus raptus is Ben’s top pick because at its heart, Ridley Scott’s 1979 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/">Alien</a> is a horror film, and this monster ticks all the boxes.</p>

<h4 id="the-creature-from-the-black-lagoonhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicreature_from_the_black_lagoon"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creature_from_the_Black_Lagoon">The Creature from the Black Lagoon</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37db07b9f12a10.jpg" alt="The Creature from the Black Lagoon" /></p>

<p>Whether in its original <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046876/">1954 form</a> or its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580390/">most recent, romantic incarnation</a>, the Creature makes Ben’s list for its exceptional design, its pathos, and because childhood memories. If you’d like to know more, you can read Ben’s friend Mallory’s book, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lady-Black-Lagoon-Hollywood-Monsters/dp/1335937803/ref=sr_1_1?crid=236CB9D25CXER&amp;keywords=the lady from the black lagoon&amp;qid=1572078763&amp;sprefix=the lady from the blac %2Caps%2C146&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Lady from the Black Lagoon</em></a>, about the Creature’s designer, an overlooked name in Hollywood’s history.</p>

<h4 id="gremlinshttpsenwikipediaorgwikigremlins"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins">Gremlins</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37db07bfbee9a0.jpg" alt="Gremlins" /></p>

<p>The original <em>Gremlins</em> is fun for most, if not all the family, as it so well intersects comedy and horror. Ben appreciates how the rules are set out, but that as an audience we don’t yet know what the consequences are for breaking them. Ben is not a fan of the sequel, as it skews too much towards the funny.</p>

<h4 id="the-thing">The Thing</h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37db07c3c5a4d0.jpg" alt="The Thing" /></p>

<p>The titular Thing from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/"><em>The Thing</em></a> is terrifying in its amorphousness. It can take the shape of anything it touches, and although it involves some body horror — of which Ben isn’t a big fan — it comfortably makes Ben’s list as a full-on monster, albeit a somewhat formless one.</p>

<h4 id="graboidhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigraboid"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graboid">Graboid</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37db07c7856bf0.jpg" alt="Graboid" /></p>

<p>Ben’s final pick is the worm things from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100814/"><em>Tremors</em></a>, one of his favourite movies (and a firm favourite of Mark’s). Ben appreciates the cool, gross and classic monsteriness of these underground creatures, but is <em>not on board</em> with the name “graboid”, and he wishes to make this position absolutely clear.</p>

<h3 id="marks-pick">Mark’s pick</h3>

<p>In order of discussion</p>

<h4 id="zombiehttpsenwikipediaorgwikizombie"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie">Zombie</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37db07d2c44c20.jpg" alt="Zombie" />
For Mark, a proper zombie film ends with courage in the face of utter hopelessness. They’re one of the few fictional entities that still scare Mark. Although he originally lauded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/"><em>28 Days Later</em></a> as a great modern take on the zombie, he’s not so sure it holds up.</p>

<h4 id="audrey-iihttpslittleshopfandomcomwikiaudrey_ii"><a target="_blank" href="https://littleshop.fandom.com/wiki/Audrey_II">Audrey II</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37db07d650f550.jpg" alt="Audrey II" />
Although Ben doesn’t consider this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091419/"><em>Little Shop of Horrors</em></a> baddy scary, Mark thinks potentially being grabbed by the balls and eaten by a giant blood-sucking plant with the voice of a Motown legend to be a little intimidating.</p>

<h4 id="hannibal-lecterhttpsenwikipediaorgwikihannibal_lecter"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter">Hannibal Lecter</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37db07d9dcb420.png" alt="Hannibal Lecter" />
Hannibal the cannibal, in all his incarnations, makes Mark’s list as an almost supernaturally naughty man, but can Ben reconcile this against his criteria, or does this constitute a slippery slope?</p>

<h4 id="pennywisehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiit_character"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_(character)">Pennywise</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37db07dcee8800.jpg" alt="Pennywise" />
Mark put Pennywise the dancing clown on his list for similar reasons to Ben’s selection of the Thing. (And yes, Mark understands that Pennywise is just one form of It, but it’s the version we see most in the films.) Mark finds the films not only funny, but really scary (especially <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396484/">the first</a>).</p>

<p>Technology writer and drone expert <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/adam-juniper/">Adam Juniper</a> joins Mark to discuss machines that go bleep.</p>

<p>Adam spent many years editing and publishing books on photography, which over the years has become more about technology than chemicals.</p>

<p>He and Mark discuss the fun and frustration that can be had when delving into the world of smart home tech, and you can read more of Adam’s thoughts on this — and other desirable tech — on his <a target="_blank" href="https://techyearning.com">Tech Yearning</a> blog.</p>

<p>Like Mark, Adam had a Game Gear, which you can hear discussed in <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/e/top-5-childhood-toys-37908db4c56990/">episode 2</a> of this very podcast.</p>

<p>The pair also discuss the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU">“Privacy: It’s a Crime” campaign</a>.</p>

<p>As a listening note: the pair do talk about the Amazon Echo devices and the lady that lives inside them, but rest assured, thanks to the ingenious editing technique of <em>cutting out a bit of the word Ale*a</em>, your costly egg timer won’t be set off.</p>

<h3 id="adams-picks">Adam’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="apple-iphonehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiiphone_1st_generation"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)">Apple iPhone</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37d4e409c518f0.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone" />
Although Adam labels this the gadget that killed all other gadgets (and most tech pundits agree that the iPhone 4 is the peak of Apple’s design), the first-generation iPhone from 2007 was an indisputably magical device. Not so magical for iJustine, who recorded a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdULhkh6yeA">video unboxing her first post-iPhone AT&amp;T bill</a>.</p>

<h4 id="usb-flash-drivehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiusb_flash_drive"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive">USB flash drive</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37d4e40d7f13b0.jpg" alt="USB flash drive" />
It’s such a humble gadget that many of us don’t think about it, but the USB flash drive, USB stick, USB “key” (it’s not a key) or “jump drive” (if you’re <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_McElroy">Griffin McElroy</a> from 20012) is ubiquitous, and astonishingly </p>

<h4 id="parrot-ar-dronehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiparrot_ardrone"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_AR.Drone">Parrot AR drone</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37d4e413326d70.jpg" alt="Parrot AR drone" />
Most boys wanted a remote-controlled car when they were growing up, but now 21st-century children get to want tiny helicopters that can be controlled with a smartphone. Adam was captivated by the Parrot drone when he saw one at a trade show, and has vastly upped his drone game in the intervening years.</p>

<h4 id="jaguar-i-pacehttpsenwikipediaorgwikijaguar_i-pace"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_I-Pace">Jaguar I-Pace</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37d4e417c737d0.jpg" alt="Jaguar I-Pace" />
Adam picked this model, but wanted to submit electric cars in general. He likes the full-on gadgetiness of an electric car, and is also pleased to be able to talk about one that isn’t a Tesla.</p>

<h3 id="smart-speakerhttpsenwikipediaorgwikismart_speaker"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_speaker">Smart speaker</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37d4e429ecc1a0.png" alt="Apple HomePod" />
Adam has tested all the major smart speaker brands, and prefers the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePod">Apple HomePod</a>, which is less of a smart speaker and more of… well, a really good-sounding speaker. But whether it’s an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo">Amazon Echo</a> or a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Home">Google Home</a>, smart speakers are wonderfully useful gadgets for controlling your home and reminding you to take the chicken out of the oven.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="apple-ipadhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiipad_1st_generation"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation)">Apple iPad</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37d4e4407138c0.jpg" alt="Apple iPad" />
Mark picked the device that, incidentally was in design before the iPhone, but wouldn’t come out for another three years. This tablet has gone through a number of design iterations and is now available in a multitude of sizes, and is now firmly one of Mark’s everyday carries (as the tech writers would have it). He especially loves the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro#Third_generation">2018 Pro</a>.</p>

<h4 id="flip-videohttpsenwikipediaorgwikiflip_video"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Video">Flip Video</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37d4e44479efc0.jpg" alt="Flip Video" />
Mark was given a Flip camera as a parting gift after leaving a job in 2008, and it has remained one of his favourite gadgets of old. It was incredibly relevant for a very short period of time, before it was superseded by that dratted iPhone. The revelation was not only its point-and-shoot simplicity or its in-built storage, but the ease of transfer to a computer, compared with a MiniDV camera from the same era.</p>

<h4 id="nintendo-switchhttpsenwikipediaorgwikinintendo_switch"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch">Nintendo Switch</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37d4e4490fa480.jpg" alt="Nintendo Switch" />
Although Mark grew up without the joy of consoles as an everyday part of his life, he always identified as a Sega fan. And yes, like everyone else in the early 2000s he had a Nintendo Wii, but it wouldn’t be until the first ad for the Switch in 2016 that he’d begin his love affair with this powerful, portable and flexible games console. And Mark can still play <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sega.com/games/sonicmania">Sonic</a> on it.</p>

<h4 id="apple-airpodshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiairpods"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods">Apple AirPods</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37d4e44d497da0.jpg" alt="Apple AirPods" />
The pair’s third Apple device is something Mark picks without apology, as it’s a marvel in miniaturised tech. These wireless earbuds have been oft-copied, but they do “just work”, in Apple parlance (and given that Mark has some Sony wireless earbuds to compare them to, that phrase is more than just marketing.)</p>

  <h4>Simon Heap</h4>
  <p>Director of Rugged Interactive, Cornish innovative sport design firm and maker of fitness equipment for everyone &#8211; Olympians, big brands and anyone with great ideas.</p>

<p>Mark speaks down-the-line with product designer, <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/simon-heap/">Simon Heap</a>, as the two share their top five world-changing products, and gently collide over what can be construed a “product”.</p>

<p>Simon has dedicated his life to making, as he calls it, “a better mouse trap”, and now specialises in designing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.designforsport.com">products for sport</a>. You might know Simon’s work from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08h1t91">Dragons’ Den</a>, or perhaps you’ve bought his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000YEK8GI">potato masher</a>?</p>

<p>Simon once designed a CD player and argued for a sense of jeopardy within the mechanism (in the same way that there is a way to put a record on wrong), and Mark finds another member to join the ranks of those who mourn the passing of the MiniDisc. He also discovers that the Japanese may have the word he’s long searched for, to describe that wonderful sense of joy and satisfaction you get from a mechanical interaction: a good button, a sturdy spring or a crunchy click.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="simons-picks">Simon’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="the-wheelhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiwheel"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel">The wheel</a></h4>

<p>It’s round. It can be used to move things. Attach two of them to a thing, and you can move it even easier. It’s what Ford Prefect called “the single simplest machine in the entire universe”. It’s the wheel.</p>

<h4 id="the-matchhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimatch"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match">The match</a></h4>

<p>Simon picks fire — or more specifically, the match — for the ability to create heat and light at will, therefore allowing people tilling the fields all day to come home and further their education at night.</p>

<h4 id="penicillinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikipenicillin"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin">Penicillin</a></h4>

<p>This 1928 invention is Simon’s third pick, and something that came up in <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/e/top-5-journeys-to-scientific-discovery-379c511ff180a6/#penicillinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikipenicillin">List Envy’s very first episode</a>.  He argues that, while most of the pair’s choices spread communication across the globe, penicillin spreads health.</p>

<h4 id="world-wide-webhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiworld_wide_web"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a></h4>

<p>Simon knows this, Mark knows this, and in case you didn’t before, now you do: the Internet and the Web are not the same thing. With that out of the way, Simon picked this as an extraordinary communication tool (for good or ill), and Mark brings up the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">Mosaic web browser</a> as the first widely adopted way of “surfing hyperspace”.</p>

<h4 id="marine-chronometerhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimarine_chronometer"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_chronometer">Marine chronometer</a></h4>

<p>This device enabled travel across the sea in a way that would previously have been infinitely more dangerous, allowed for more accurate mapping, and ultimately brought the world closer together by making it more navigable.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="wireless-radiohttpsenwikipediaorgwikihistory_of_radiostart_of_the_20th_century"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_radio#Start_of_the_20th_century">Wireless radio</a></h4>

<p>Mark used the <a target="_blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:De_Forest_RJ6_Audion_radio_receiver.jpg">de Forest RJ6</a> as an early example of a commercially-available radio receiver, as the first in a set of communication devices he believes have propelled us.</p>

<h4 id="commercial-aviationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicommercial_aviation"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_aviation">Commercial aviation</a></h4>

<p>Mark discusses the first commercial aeroplane flight, a short hop in 1914, which Simon contrasts with Kitty Hawk’s first public outing in 1903.</p>

<h4 id="nokia-8110httpsenwikipediaorgwikinokia_8110"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_8110">Nokia 8110</a></h4>

<p>Mark picks this un-smart, by 2019 standards unsexy flip phone, as being among the first mobile phones to be desirable consumer products. Not to be outdone, this is the point in the episode in which Simon’s landline starts chirping in.</p>

<h4 id="apple-macintoshhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimacintosh"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a></h4>

<p>Mark picked this computer — which was far from Apple’s first — again as a desirable object, that democratised, commoditised and made friendly the idea of computing. Simon suggested the first <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3">iMac</a> might have been a good pick.</p>

<h4 id="audio-cassettehttpsenwikipediaorgwikicassette_tape"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape">Audio cassette</a></h4>

<p>Mark picked the hissy, mushy-sounding cassette as an interesting device in its own right, saying that, unlike vinyl or CDs, cassette tapes mark their last use: they have to be manually rewound… unless you have one of those fancy machines that messes with the tape heads and flips them around.</p>

<p>Mark takes flight with speaker, author and “the entrepreneur’s godmother” Alison Edgar, to build a list of the best places it takes too long to fly to.</p>

<p>Alison flies a lot, and finds pinning her destinations on a map lends itself to a sense of perspective. Mark responds by finding another way to tie this into his favourite sci-fi series, <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>.</p>

<p>Alison, like Mark, enjoys — or enjoyed - a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Mary_(cocktail)">Bloody Mary</a>, which has — for reasons best known to others — become de rigueur for those who enjoy boozing above the clouds.</p>

<p><em>Public service announcement:</em> if you have Netflix and are on a long-haul flight, do remember to download a season of something to watch before you fly. No-one wants to be caught short if the in-flight media selection is sub-par.</p>

<p>Born in Glasgow and a self-styled extravert, Alison is not content with spending all day every day on the beach or in the local British theme pub, watching endless <em>Only Fools</em> repeats. She wants to mix it up with the people that make up the places she visits.</p>

<p>As well as a couple of good cocktail recommendations, this episode also includes a game you can play at the airport.</p>

<h3 id="alisons-picks">Alison’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="cape-townhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicape_town"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town">Cape Town</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37ca5afc3e8830.jpg" alt="Cape Town" /></p>

<p>Alison lived in Cape Town for a couple of years and considers it one of the most naturally beautiful cities she’s ever lived in. If you’re ever in South Africa, you absolutely must try a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/quick-and-easy/don-pedro/">Don Pedro</a>.</p>

<h4 id="californiahttpsenwikipediaorgwikicalifornia"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37ca5b05edeec0.jpg" alt="California" /></p>

<p>We’re developing a theme with Alison’s pick, but you’d be hard pressed to argue that the weather, the food and the lifestyle don’t make California a must-visit destination.</p>

<h4 id="shanghaihttpsenwikipediaorgwikishanghai"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37ca5b0eca9c00.jpg" alt="Shanghai" /></p>

<p>Alison’s third pick is a place in which she describes “sticking out like a sore thumb”, but Shanghai taught her a lot and she has very fond memories of the people and places she visited.</p>

<h4 id="dubaihttpsenwikipediaorgwikidubai"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai">Dubai</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37ca5b155765d0.jpg" alt="Dubai" /></p>

<p>Any suggestion that Alison picked this city of beautiful weather and opulent architecture purely because she got to stay in their 7-star hotel will not be tolerated. It is very hot though.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="sydneyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikisydney"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney">Sydney</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37ca5b00d108a0.jpg" alt="Sydney" /></p>

<p>Mark went flew to Sydney via Singapore, and did most of the things you’re supposed to do in Sydney. This is also a top pick for Alison.</p>

<h4 id="new-york-cityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikinew_york_city"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37ca5b0b387490.jpg" alt="New York City" /></p>

<p>Mark’s second pick is not necessarily a place you’d want to live, but definitely one you should take a good long look at. It’s not on Alison’s list, but perhaps it can make the final?</p>

<h4 id="egypthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiegypt"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt">Egypt</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37ca5b1263c850.jpg" alt="Egypt" /></p>

<p>Although it’s not necessarily a place Mark wants to visit alone, he’s captivated by the history of Egypt.</p>

<h4 id="jamaicahttpsenwikipediaorgwikijamaica"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37ca5b1a439f00.jpg" alt="Jamaica" /></p>

<p>This nearly made Alison’s list, but it makes Mark’s because of its culture and its weather. That said, the disparity in wealth was a concern for both parties.</p>

    <description>Prepare to have your face melted clean off as you enter a whole new world of mouth noise, with guest Tani Levitt. And remember, if you’re sitting in the plash zone, you will get spittle all over you.

Tani presents SpeshFX, a narrative podcast that dives deep into the fascinating world of competitive beatboxing. If you’re familiar with the rap battle scene, it’s like that but nicer, and where people make their O face when being hit by several megatons of sick beats (just helping ease you in with the lingo).

Tani got into the scene via his brother, and started charting not only the beatbox battle scene, but also his own education, through SpeshFX. If you want a primer, start with his Beatboxing Basics YouTube playlist.

The world of the beatbox battle

Beatbox battles are judged equally on musicality, technicality, originality and stage presence. Both Tani’s and Mark’s picks have these qualities in spades, and especially for Tani who’s well-versed in this world, it can be difficult to rank performers when they’re at such a high level. So, mad props to all those spittin’ bars. (Is that a thing?)

Honourable mentions

Tani’s picks

In order of discussion:

Alem



This French master is Tani’s first pick for his technicality. He’s a multi-award-winner, having taken trophies home throughout the decade. Tani says his battle spirit and technicality are unparalleled.

Alexinho



Tani believes this Frenchman has the best singular set in beatbox history, and cites his 2017 battle against Two.H as “a masterstroke of technicality” and “90 seconds of non-stop power”. Check out the linked video, and watch for the tennis ball drop.

Hiss



This super-young and confoundingly-talented South Korean beat NaPoM to the finals in 2017. Tani describes him as a human metronome with a wide range of sounds. His studio album /Voiss/, released this year is available now.

Gene Shinozaki



This Boston beatboxer, originally from California is Tani’s favourite, for his pure musical talent. Ha made his stamp on the beatbox world in 2015 with his set entitled Jigsaw, for the Grand Beatbox Battle.

Mark’s picks

In order of discussion:

NaPoM



Hailing from the US, Neil Patrick Meadows (NaPoM) is Mark’s first pick as an entertainment powerhouse. He learned much of his technique from Tani’s #1 pick Alem, and Mark’s guest says he “redefined, with his lip roll, what it meant to be a cultured beatboxer”.

Codfish



Mark’s second pick caught him by surprise, which is why he placed perhaps higher than the other battler he was up against the first time Mark saw him. Mark enjoys the Aussie’s swagger and his ability to lift the energy of a room, and as of two weeks before this episode was recorded, his YouTube channel passed a million followers.

D-Low



Mark appreciates this Brit’s stage presence, entertainment value and sense of humour, and his ability to drop out of a beat, make a goof and unfailingly return. He won the Under-18 UK Beatbox Battle in 2014, and made it to the 2015 World Championships on the back of his wildcard video submission. Tani appreciated his moves in his battle against Colaps in this year’s Grand Beatbox Battle.

MB14



Frenchman Mohamed Belkhir, better known as MB14, is Mark’s final pick for his “amazing mouth gymnastics”, but he’s not been a solo battler for more than 15 months, having come up as part of Berywam. You can also check out his loop station album.

    <link>https://listenvypod.com/e/top-5-latin-boogaloo-albums-37be891c8190f4/</link>
    <description>This week, Mark embarks on a journey of musical discovery, with Oliver Wang, co-host of the Heat Rocks podcast. If you’re not familiar with latin boogaloo, it’s time to get acquainted.

Oliver loves this fusion of more traditional latin melodies — with complex chords and meandering melodies — and the growing soul music movement, prevalent in 1960s New York, not just because of its inherently physical nature — this stuff just makes you wanna move — but because of what it teaches us about the culture at the time.

Just as a previous generation of immigrants embarked on a cultural exchange with the US and established themselves as the kings and queens of mambo and cha-cha-cha, so a new wave of second-generation American-raised Puerto Ricans, Cubans and Dominicans (to name a few) brought their musical heritage and mashed it up with the popular doo-wop and early R&amp;amp;B styles of the day.

Latin boogaloo wasn’t a lauded genre by purists, who saw it as a bit of a debasement of the complex and intricate style they were used to. It’s a story as old as time.

Oliver’s picks

In order of discussion:

Gypsy Woman — Joe Bataan



Joe Bataan grew up in Spanish Harlem and was at one time a Puerto Rican gang leader, but he avoided trouble by forming a band with some boys from the neighbourhood, which he took to Fania Records. Oliver appreciates Bataan’s vocals as well as the latin music chops of the band, which is what makes it his #1 pick.

I Like it Like That — Pete Rodríguez



Fans of Cardi B will recognise the chorus of this album’s hit single, as it opens I Like It, and is heavily sampled throughout.

Wanted Dead or Alive — Joe Cuba



Bang! Bang!, this album’s first track, was the first giant latin boogaloo hit. Mark believes it both slaps and bangs. Like Pete Rodriguez, Joe Cuba got his start a little earlier, so was ready to capitalise on the genre’s, albeit short-lived, boom.

Acid — Ray Barretto



Released on Fania, this is a good representation of how an older musician adapted to the latin soul music movement, and is what Oliver considers one of the best exemplars of the genre.

My Latin Soul — Bobby Matos and the Combo Conquistadores



In an interview he did with Oliver, Matos revealed how dissatisfied he was with this debut effort, insisting his later work was much more sophisticated and less musically naive, but Olives loves the raw feel of this album.

Mark’s picks

In order of discussion:

Ali Baba — Louie Ramirez



Mark enjoyed the variety of music on offer with this album: the playfulness, sometimes downright silliness, the catchiness of the melodies, and the satisfying sound of brass recorded and played back from vinyl. And for Oliver’s part, you can’t talk about Louie Ramirez without bringing up his production partner Bobby Marin.

Watermelon Man! — Mongo Santamaria



Mark is always a sucker for a cover of Herbie Hancock’s /Watermelon Man/. He felt this album was perhaps a little more sophisticated or stylish than some of the other offerings, but Oliver thinks of this as more of a porto-boogaloo album than a boogaloo album proper. Given that, perhaps more attention should be paid to Mongo’s son Monguito, who had a great career in the genre. If you want to hear what that sounds like, Oliver recommends /Hey Sister/.

Laberinto de Pasiones — La Lupe



Mark likes the sexiness of this album, and particularly the cover of Fever, which is, to use his words, “dripping with raunch”. Minus 10 points. La Lupe was one of the few notable latin boogaloo artists around at the time, so plus 10 points.

At the Party — Hector Rivera



While the title track is fun and energetic, Mark appreciated the smoother stylings and melody of Pra Vas Wilma. Oliver says that this album, like perhaps dozens of others at the era, were able to catch lightning in a bottle, even if we won’t remember them in decades to come.

<p>This week, Mark embarks on a journey of musical discovery, with <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/o-wang/">Oliver Wang</a>, co-host of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maximumfun.org/shows/heat-rocks">Heat Rocks</a> podcast. If you’re not familiar with latin boogaloo, it’s time to get acquainted.</p>

<p>Oliver loves this fusion of more traditional latin melodies — with complex chords and meandering melodies — and the growing soul music movement, prevalent in 1960s New York, not just because of its inherently physical nature — this stuff just makes you wanna move — but because of what it teaches us about the culture at the time.</p>

<p>Just as a previous generation of immigrants embarked on a cultural exchange with the US and established themselves as the kings and queens of mambo and cha-cha-cha, so a new wave of second-generation American-raised Puerto Ricans, Cubans and Dominicans (to name a few) brought their musical heritage and mashed it up with the popular doo-wop and early R&amp;B styles of the day.</p>

<p>Latin boogaloo wasn’t a lauded genre by purists, who saw it as a bit of a debasement of the complex and intricate style they were used to. It’s a story as old as time.</p>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="gypsy-woman-joe-bataanhttpssonglinkalbumgbi1467055315"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/album/gb/i/1467055315">Gypsy Woman — Joe Bataan</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37be88786a53f0.jpg" alt="Gypsy Woman — Joe Bataan" /></p>

<p>Joe Bataan grew up in Spanish Harlem and was at one time a Puerto Rican gang leader, but he avoided trouble by forming a band with some boys from the neighbourhood, which he took to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fania_Records">Fania Records</a>. Oliver appreciates Bataan’s vocals as well as the latin music chops of the band, which is what makes it his #1 pick.</p>

<h4 id="i-like-it-like-that-pete-rodriguezhttpssonglinkalbumgbi1464275791"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/album/gb/i/1464275791">I Like it Like That — Pete Rodríguez</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37be887ea3a690.jpg" alt="I Like it Like That — Pete Rodríguez" /></p>

<p>Fans of Cardi B will recognise the chorus of this album’s hit single, as it opens <em>I Like It</em>, and is heavily sampled throughout.</p>

<h4 id="wanted-dead-or-alive-joe-cubahttpssonglinkalbumgbi1466118023"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/album/gb/i/1466118023">Wanted Dead or Alive — Joe Cuba</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37be88834f7b60.jpg" alt="Wanted Dead or Alive — Joe Cuba" /></p>

<p><em>Bang! Bang!</em>, this album’s first track, was the first giant latin boogaloo hit. Mark believes it both slaps and bangs. Like Pete Rodriguez, Joe Cuba got his start a little earlier, so was ready to capitalise on the genre’s, albeit short-lived, boom.</p>

<h4 id="acid-ray-barrettohttpssonglinkalbumgbi1464279158"><a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/album/gb/i/1464279158">Acid — Ray Barretto</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37be8888fd7df0.jpg" alt="Acid — Ray Barretto" /></p>

<p>Released on Fania, this is a good representation of how an older musician adapted to the latin soul music movement, and is what Oliver considers one of the best exemplars of the genre.</p>

<h4 id="my-latin-soul-bobby-matos-and-the-combo-conquistadoreshttpswwwdiscogscombobby-matos-and-the-combo-conquistadores-my-latin-soulrelease437553"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.discogs.com/Bobby-Matos-And-The-Combo-Conquistadores-My-Latin-Soul/release/437553">My Latin Soul — Bobby Matos and the Combo Conquistadores</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37be888eb173f0.jpg" alt="My Latin Soul — Bobby Matos and the Combo" /></p>

<p>In an interview he did with Oliver, Matos revealed how dissatisfied he was with this debut effort, insisting his later work was much more sophisticated and less musically naive, but Olives loves the raw feel of this album.</p>

Oliver’s picks

In order of discussion:

Gypsy Woman — Joe Bataan



Joe Bataan grew up in Spanish Harlem and was at one time a Puerto Rican gang leader, but he avoided trouble by forming a band with some boys from the neighbourhood, which he took to Fania Records. Oliver appreciates Bataan’s vocals as well as the latin music chops of the band, which is what makes it his #1 pick.

I Like it Like That — Pete Rodríguez



Fans of Cardi B will recognise the chorus of this album’s hit single, as it opens I Like It, and is heavily sampled throughout.

Wanted Dead or Alive — Joe Cuba



Bang! Bang!, this album’s first track, was the first giant latin boogaloo hit. Mark believes it both slaps and bangs. Like Pete Rodriguez, Joe Cuba got his start a little earlier, so was ready to capitalise on the genre’s, albeit short-lived, boom.

Acid — Ray Barretto



Released on Fania, this is a good representation of how an older musician adapted to the latin soul music movement, and is what Oliver considers one of the best exemplars of the genre.

My Latin Soul — Bobby Matos and the Combo Conquistadores



In an interview he did with Oliver, Matos revealed how dissatisfied he was with this debut effort, insisting his later work was much more sophisticated and less musically naive, but Olives loves the raw feel of this album.

Mark’s picks

<p>Musician, writer and improv comedian <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/tom-clabon/">Tom Clabon</a> joins Mark to fight about which of Birmingham’s bands are best, and possibly what the word “definitive” means.</p>

<p>And by Birmingham, we mean Birmingham. The proper one, in the UK.</p>

<p>Tom has performed in bands (like <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/bussy-the-band">Bussy</a>), and like Mark knows the pain of publishing music to Bandcamp to little fanfare. But they’re both absolutely not bitter about it. Tom also presented <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/indiemix_brum">Indie Mixtape</a> on local station <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brumradio.com/">Brum Radio</a>.</p>

<p>The pair share gig-playing memories, the venues they’ve nearly been thrown out of (Mark), and the ones they’ve scammed their way into (Tom’s dad).</p>

<p>If you’ve heard of the majority of Tom’s picks, then you already know more about Birmingham’s music scene in 2019 than Mark does. If you’ve heard of the majority of Mark’s picks, then you’re a granddad and death will claim you soon.</p>

<p>Also, Mark tries to coin a phrase for the pro-life movement, but doesn’t do a good job, and Tom threatens to give Mark a weird handshake.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378eabf3eb1df0.jpg" alt="Johnny Foreigner" /></p>

<p>Tom saw two members of this indie four-piece play when he was learning to be a sound engineer.</p>

<h4 id="muteshttpsmutesukbandcampcom"><a target="_blank" href="https://mutesuk.bandcamp.com/">Mutes</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378eac1be72ba0.jpg" alt="Mutes" /></p>

<p>This Krautrock project just about makes the definition of “band”, but deserves notoriety for interestingness and reflective lyrics.</p>

<h4 id="hoopla-bluehttpstwittercomhooplablue"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/HooplaBlue">Hoopla Blue</a></h4>

<p>Expect combinations of sounds you won’t hear elsewhere, from this neo-folk five-piece.</p>

<h4 id="the-cosmicshttpstwittercomthecosmicsband"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/thecosmicsband">The Cosmics</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378eac87a62da0.jpg" alt="The Cosmics" /></p>

<p>This noisy garage punk band make Tom’s list because they’re really, really good to listen to.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="electric-light-orchestrahttpsenwikipediaorgwikielectric_light_orchestra"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Light_Orchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378eac00c20340.jpg" alt="Electric Light Orchestra" /></p>

<p>Mark argues that Alan Partridge favourite ELO is deserving of a high place as an innovative and inspirational band. It’s worth noting that the song <em>Livin’ Thing</em> is not political.</p>

<h4 id="mistys-big-adventurehttpsenwikipediaorgwikimisty27s_big_adventure"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty%27s_Big_Adventure">Misty’s Big Adventure</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378eac2a50e5f0.jpg" alt="Misty&#8217;s Big Adventure" /></p>

<p>Currently an eight-piece, but occasionally fluctuating in size, Misty’s are an eclectic and compelling listen, and personal favourites of Mark for the last 20 years. Also Dave Gorman likes them.</p>

<h4 id="the-moody-blueshttpsenwikipediaorgwikithe_moody_blues"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moody_Blues">The Moody Blues</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378eac721da2b0.jpg" alt="The Moody Blues" /></p>

<p>This three-piece 60s prog rock band hit the big time back in the day but don’t make a lot of noise about it, or so says Mark.</p>

<p>Musician and podcaster <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/brendan-audiosmith-hutchins/">Brendan Hutchins</a> joins Mark to discuss guitar music from the early 21st century.</p>

<p>Brendan loves pop punk for its energy and reasons of nostalgia, and has lots of names to bring to the table. He also helps Mark define what <em>isn’t</em> pop punk.</p>

<p>Mark based his list on bands who had seminal or otherwise important albums during the early 2000s, and while Brendan’s picks are perhaps from slightly younger bands, none of them formed post-2005.</p>

<p>Mark shares stories about plectra, music he discovered through Kerrang! Radio, and stuff he used to play on his old radio show (like <a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/1142156092">this from Of Kings and Captains</a>).</p>

<p>Brendan also sings the praises of Bowling for Soup’s guitarist, who performs tricks with his pick!</p>

<h3 id="brendans-picks">Brendan’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="goldfingerhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigoldfinger_band"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfinger_(band)">Goldfinger</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378a3134f729d0.jpg" alt="Goldfinger" /></p>

<p>Brendan picks this ska-peppered, high-energy four-piece from LA. Mark wonders if they’re too aggressive, but Brendan quickly counters. Mark once saw them support Reel Big Fish, and both of them love <a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/254825686"><em>Superman</em></a>. Also Brendan recommended <a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/309670418"><em>Counting the Days</em></a>.</p>

<h4 id="blink-182httpsenwikipediaorgwikiblink-182"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink-182">Blink-182</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378a3141d5fe60.jpg" alt="Blink-182" /></p>

<p>Although <a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/album/gb/i/1440839912"><em>Enema of the State</em></a> came out in the previous century, Brendan would appear to have made a solid choice in this cheeky Californian trio. But will pedantry win the day?</p>

<h4 id="good-charlottehttpsenwikipediaorgwikigood_charlotte"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Charlotte">Good Charlotte</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378a3150feea00.jpg" alt="Good Charlotte" /></p>

<p>Although they faded a little from Brendan’s heart after their self-titled album, these Maryland boys still rank highly for both.</p>

<h4 id="new-found-gloryhttpsenwikipediaorgwikinew_found_glory"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Found_Glory">New Found Glory</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378a315cd416c0.jpg" alt="New Found Glory" /></p>

<p>Viewed by some — at least Brendan’s friend Aaron — these Floridians definitely have that pop punk energy, but is Brendan picking them out of a sense of duty, and will that ding him come the final reckoning?</p>

<h4 id="sugarculthttpsenwikipediaorgwikisugarcult"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarcult">Sugarcult</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined379d889ed7c520.jpg" alt="Sugarcult" /></p>

<p>Mark had never heard of these Californians, but Mark was charmed by <a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/1402936315"><em>Bouncing off the Walls</em></a>.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="sum-41httpsenwikipediaorgwikisum_41"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_41">Sum 41</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378a30ec4e8c00.jpg" alt="Sum 41" /></p>

<p>Mark argues that this Canadian four-or-five-piece — depending on the era — have the right energy and sound, but they don’t even make Brendan’s honourable mentions.</p>

<h4 id="green-dayhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigreen_day"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day">Green Day</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378a30f82650d0.png" alt="Green Day" /></p>

<p>This would appear to be a lock, but on <em>List Envy</em>, nothing is certain. This Californian trio jumped the shark in 2005 by going from talking about girls to talking about politics. Also Brendan saw them live, twice, and they were in his face.</p>

<h4 id="bowling-for-souphttpsenwikipediaorgwikibowling_for_soup"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_for_Soup">Bowling for Soup</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378a30fee15690.jpg" alt="Bowling for Soup" /></p>

<p>Brendan’s friend wanted these Texans bumped from the list, but Mark insists that <a target="_blank" href="https://song.link/gb/i/418437027"><em>Girls All the Bad Guys Want</em></a> is definitive of the genre.</p>

<h4 id="the-all-american-rejectshttpsenwikipediaorgwikithe_all-american_rejects"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_All-American_Rejects">The All-American Rejects</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378a310fcb2c10.jpg" alt="All-American Rejects" /></p>

<p>This Oklahoman four-piece don’t make it anywhere near Brendan’s list, which does not bode well for the final. Perhaps it could be considered a <em>Swing, Swing</em> and a miss.</p>

<h4 id="fountains-of-waynehttpsenwikipediaorgwikifountains_of_wayne"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountains_of_Wayne">Fountains of Wayne</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined378a316682ba00.jpg" alt="Fountains of Wayne" /></p>

<p>Brendan’s never heard of this New York foursome, nor of their smash hit <em>Stacey’s Mom</em>. Mark’s case for adding them is not strong, as they fail on almost every test of the genre.</p>

<p>Mark talks to podcaster and “unapologetic Anglophile” <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/jen-tierney/">Jen Tierney</a> about the foods eaten and loved by “a nation of shopkeepers”.</p>

<p>As a young girl, Jen was persuaded to watch a BBC adaptation of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, and has since made it her mission to consume all things Brit. As well as eating, Jen likes to cook, learning from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off">/The Great British Bake Off/</a> and demonstrating more knowledge of British baked goods than the host of this podcast. Case in point: the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popover">popover</a>.</p>

<h3 id="friends-dont-take-friends-to-greggs">Friends don’t take friends to Greggs</h3>

<p>This is a vital public service announcement, brought to you by an experience Jen had in Brighton. Brits, please do not take your non-British friends to Greggs, even for the lols. It’s just not worth it, even if they do now serve a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=greggs vegan sausage roll">sausage roll that the Internet freaked out about</a>.</p>

<h3 id="jens-picks">Jen’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="afternoon-teahttpsenwikipediaorgwikitea_mealafternoon_tea"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_(meal)#Afternoon_tea">Afternoon tea</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37a9609207b7e0.jpg" alt="Afternoon tea" /></p>

<p>You’ve got your tea, you’ve got your scones — or scones, your pronunciation may vary — and a variety of things to spread on top of them. If you’re lucky, you have some tiny little cucumber sandwiches. But it’s all about the ritual.</p>

<p>Jen’s first pick may open up deep, centuries-old battle scars between Cornish people and Devonshire people, who to this day cannot agree on whether you put the cream on a scone first, and then the jam, or do it the wrong way around. (This rule does <em>not</em> apply to the American lunch staple, the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter_and_jelly_sandwich">peanut butter and jelly sandwich</a>).</p>

<h4 id="cornish-pastyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikipastycornish_pasty"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasty#Cornish_pasty">Cornish pasty</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37a960b226d510.jpg" alt="Cornish pasty" /></p>

<p>This is Britain’s offering to the savoury pastry gods, joining the ranks of the empanada and the calzone. Jen got to experience this particular delight in a chain store in Brighton (which makes good pasties, at least Mark thinks so, although <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186402-d4925405-Reviews-The_Pasty_Shop-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html">according to TripAdvisor</a>, you should not try the veggie pasties).</p>

<h4 id="full-english-breakfasthttpsenwikipediaorgwikifull_breakfast"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_breakfast">Full English breakfast</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37a960c8ced9c0.jpg" alt="Full English breakfast" /></p>

<p>Bacon. Egg. Sausage. Beans. Fried bread. Fried potato (if you’re good). Fried tomato (if you’re nasty). Black pudding (optional). White pudding (even more optional). It’s a comprehensive payload of complex carbs, proteins and fats… everything a growing girl needs. Just probably not every day.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="fish-and-chipshttpsenwikipediaorgwikifish_and_chips"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_and_chips">Fish and chips</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37a960a2849ac0.jpg" alt="Fish and chips" /></p>

<p>Mark is aware of the responsibility of building a definitive list, and so although he doesn’t hold battered fish in the highest regard, the suffix “and chips” — or as the Scots call it, “supper” — is a shoe-in for his number one. If you haven’t, you should try a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saveloy">saveloy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sunday-roasthttpsenwikipediaorgwikisunday_roast"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_roast">Sunday roast</a></h3>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37a960bd40a110.jpg" alt="Sunday roast" /></p>

<p>Roast potatoes. Mashed potatoes. Other assorted vegetables. Chicken or beef (or turkey if it’s easter). <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_pudding">Yorkshire pudding</a>. Stuffing. Gravy. Delicious. And then… and then… there’s the roast parsnip, the lying turd in the punch bowl that is the British Sunday roast.</p>

<h4 id="baltihttpsenwikipediaorgwikibalti_food"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balti_(food)">Balti</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37a960da31afd0.jpg" alt="Balti" /></p>

<p>Mark’s home city of Birmingham claims this curry — usually containing lamb but equally chicken or veg (because if you haven’t tried a curried potato, you haven’t lived) — as its own, having been introduced to Adil’s restaurant in the 1970s. Mark’s recommendation is lamb and spinach, and if you’re pushing the boat out, get a keema naan on the side. Next time you’re in Birmingham, come to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balti_Triangle">Balti Triangle</a> and enjoy a taste sensation.</p>

<h3 id="more-of-jen">More of Jen</h3>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.htmamcast.com/2018/03/07/how-to-make-an-ep/">Mark was a guest on Jen’s erstwhile podcast</a> back in March 2018, talking about some songs he’d made, but Jen has a new podcast all about parenting, called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opdwpodcast.com">Our Parents Did What?</a>, which, if you enjoy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maximumfun.org/shows/sawbones">Sawbones</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://thispodcastwillkillyou.com/">This Podcast Will Kill You</a>, you’ll be sure to love (you’ll quickly become acquainted with how charming Jen is, as you listen to this episode).</p>

  <br />


<p>This week, Mark is joined by podcaster, improv comedian and Harry Potter superfan <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/cats-cabinet-of-curiosities/">Cat Turner</a>, to collaborate on a list of the best five characters in JK Rowling’s Hogwarts universe.</p>

<p>If spoilers are a thing you want to avoid, maybe skip this one until you’re all caught up. Like Mark maybe should’ve.</p>

<p>Cat grew up listening to Stephen Fry read the Harry Potter books, and wants to sort her soon-to-arrive hamster into the appropriate Hogwarts house, but she insists she isn’t a nerd about it.</p>

<p>Mark’s seen some of the Harry Potter films and listened, a little distractedly, to the first four Potter audiobooks.</p>

<p>As well as knowing everything there is to know about Harry Potter, Cat is also a maths genius, which is something she credits partially with her own Professor McGonagall. Cat also presents <a target="_blank" href="https://catscabinetofcuriosities.podiant.co/">Cat’s Cabinet of Curiosities</a>, a podcast uncovering the weird things people believe, like that the Titanic was switched at the last minute, or that Beyoncé faked her pregnancy.</p>

<h3 id="cats-guide-to-hogwarts-houses">Cat’s guide to Hogwarts houses</h3>

<ul>
<li>Gryffindors are brave, but if you self-identify as one, you’re an idiot.</li>
<li>Ravenclaws are clever but a bit up themselves.</li>
<li>Slytherin are cunning, but the less said about them the better.</li>
<li>Hufflepuff is clearly the best house. Work hard and stick to it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="we-have-bones-to-pick-with-jk-rowling">We have bones to pick with JK Rowling</h3>

<ul>
<li>Put diversity properly into your book, and don’t try and retrofit it after the fact.</li>
<li>Rowling follows <a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERF">TERF</a>s on Twitter.</li>
<li>The American Hogwarts equivalent, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.salon.com/2016/07/01/pottermore_problems_scholars_and_writers_call_foul_on_j_k_rowlings_north_american_magic/">Ilvermorny, is problematic</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some characters we like, but didn&#8217;t make it into our lists. If you finish the episode notes before you get to the end, relax; we know and we address it.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="cats-picks">Cat’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="rubeus-hagridhttpsenmwikibooksorgwikimuggles27_guide_to_harry_pottercharactersrubeus_hagrid"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Rubeus_Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined379079bbdde490.jpeg" alt="Rubeus Hagrid" />
We could all stand to be a little bit more like Hogwarts’ Keeper of the Keys and Grounds. He’s Cat’s top pick as a character with kindness, heart, and the ability to learn from his mistakes. She would have liked a little more back story into the character’s early life, as the son of a human man and a giant woman.</p>

<h4 id="regulus-blackhttpsenmwikibooksorgwikimuggles27_guide_to_harry_pottercharactersregulus_black"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Regulus_Black">Regulus Black</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined379079eaf0fab0.jpg" alt="Regulus Black" />
While his brother Sirius was sorted into Gryffindor, Regulus was sorted into Slytherin and dragged into the Death Eaters. He’s a top pick for Cat as a once conflicted character who makes the ultimate sacrifice, for the right reasons.</p>

<h4 id="lavender-brownhttpsenmwikibooksorgwikimuggles27_guide_to_harry_pottercharacterslavender_brown"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Lavender_Brown">Lavender Brown</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37907a10c45c00.jpg" alt="Lavender Brown" />
Cat picks this true hero of Hogwarts and fully paid-up member of “the DA” because femininity should never be viewed as a negative trait.</p>

<h4 id="professor-mcgonagallhttpsenmwikibooksorgwikimuggles27_guide_to_harry_pottercharactersminerva_mcgonagall"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Minerva_McGonagall">Professor McGonagall</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37907a45110800.jpg" alt="Professor McGonagall" />
Cat likes Minerva McGonagall because she knows how to walk the fine line between a lightly conspiratorial chat with a student, and the discipline that’s necessary to wield as a Head of House. She also provided a much-needed moral compass to Dumbledore.</p>

<h4 id="dobby-the-house-elfhttpsenwikibooksorgwikimuggles27_guide_to_harry_pottercharactersdobby"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Dobby">Dobby the house elf</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37907a772af580.jpg" alt="Dobby the house elf" />
Cat’s final pick is a character who adds some essential comic relief, but who also has a great amount of heart. Or had. You were warned about spoilers.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="professor-snapehttpsenmwikibooksorgwikimuggles27_guide_to_harry_pottercharactersseverus_snape"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Severus_Snape">Professor Snape</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined379079ce3ec9b0.jpg" alt="Professor Snape" />
Mark’s first pick presents as a baddy, but is a complex and contradictory character. Cat thinks he should grow up, and has some better suggestions if duality is the criteria.</p>

<h4 id="professor-dumbledorehttpsenmwikibooksorgwikimuggles27_guide_to_harry_pottercharactersalbus_dumbledore"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Albus_Dumbledore">Professor Dumbledore</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined379079f9368b30.jpg" alt="Professor Dumbledore" />
Cat throws a dark spanner into Mark’s list by schooling him on the Hogwarts headmaster’s motivations, but Mark thought it was silly to build a top five list of Potter characters and not have him in.</p>

<h4 id="neville-longbottomhttpsenmwikibooksorgwikimuggles27_guide_to_harry_pottercharactersneville_longbottom"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Neville_Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37907a380d1f40.jpg" alt="Neville Longbottom" />
Mark will always pick an underestimated underdog, and he likes Harry’s classmate for the bravery he finds in himself in later books.</p>

<h4 id="hermione-grangerhttpsenmwikibooksorgwikimuggles27_guide_to_harry_pottercharactershermione_granger"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Hermione_Granger">Hermione Granger</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://media.podiant.co/spoke/listenvy/undefined37907a612bb3f0.jpg" alt="Hermione Granger" />
Although she might induce an eye-roll, Mark’s final pick is someone with a strong moral compass, a big brain and a big heart.</p>

  <h4>Max Thomas</h4>
  <p>Clinical scientist specialising in respiratory and sleep science at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital.</p>


    <ul>
      
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/maximum_science/">Max Thomas (@maximum_science) | Twitter</a></li>
      
    </ul>
  
  <br />


<p>In this first episode, Mark speaks with sleep and respiratory scientist <a target="_blank" href="https://listenvypod.com/g/max-thomas/">Max Thomas</a>, all about science! Specifically, the unexpected or otherwise fascinating discoveries that have brought us incredible advancement. There&#8217;s also stuff about bums and willies, too, and more than one object being inserted into more than one dog.</p>

<p>Max makes a living out of making people breathless, which is a cool way of saying he studies how people breathe, and often has to make them not breathe very well so he can find out why they’re not breathing very well… you’re smart, you get it.</p>

<p>This episode was recorded on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_effect">Black Wednesday</a>, which, it has been posited, might not be the day you want to find yourself in hospital, as it’s the day when trainee doctors start their residencies. But we’re pretty sure it’s fine now.</p>

<h3 id="honourable-mentions">Honourable mentions</h3>

<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-Doh">Play-Doh</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin">Cisplatin</a> (which Mark entirely forgot to mention)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="maxs-picks">Max’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h3 id="radiocarbon-datinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiradiocarbon_dating"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating">Radiocarbon dating</a></h3>

<p>This method for determining the age of an object containing organic material is Max’s number one, purely because of the journey. We’re able to utilise a substance called carbon 14 which only came about because of nuclear testing, so… thanks?</p>

<h3 id="sildenafilhttpsenwikipediaorgwikisildenafil"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil">Sildenafil</a></h3>

<p>This drug is more commonly known by another name, and is usually blue. Its discovery was somewhat accidental as the scientists working on it were trying to treating heart-related chest pain.</p>

<h3 id="lsdhttpsenwikipediaorgwikilysergic_acid_diethylamide"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide">LSD</a></h3>

<p>This is actually Max’s fourth pick. We have Albert Hofmann to thank for this psychedelic drug, and if you’ve never heard of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/bicycle-day/">Bicycle Day</a>, you’re in for a treat.</p>

<h3 id="self-experimentationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiself-experimentation_in_medicine"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-experimentation_in_medicine">Self-experimentation</a></h3>

<p>Max celebrates German physician <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Forssmann">Werner Forssmann</a>, who was told that catheterising the heart (sticking something inside it) would cause it to fibrillate (wobble unnecessarily). So on catheterising a dog, he then decided to experiment on himself. Total lad.</p>

<h3 id="peptic-ulcershttpsenwikipediaorgwikipeptic_ulcer_disease"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer_disease">Peptic ulcers</a></h3>

<p>While the destination might not sound the most thrilling, the self-experimentation of Austrian scientists <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Warren">Robin Warren</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Marshall">Barry J Marshall</a>  makes the journey that bit more interesting, and secures the humble stomach ulcer — and its treatment — a place in Max’s list.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h3 id="x-rayhttpsenwikipediaorgwikix-ray"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray">X-Ray</a></h3>

<p>German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen was working with a cathode ray tube in 1895, when he noticed a nearby screen glowed in a dark room. So he stuck his hand in front of the tube and saw his bones in the projected image on the screen. In 1896, doctors started journaling their hair loss and other ailments caused by exposure to X-rays. 🤮</p>

<h3 id="penicillinhttpsenwikipediaorgwikipenicillin"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin">Penicillin</a></h3>

<p>1928, Sir Alexander Fleming saw mould growing in a dish of bacteria. He noticed the bacteria wasn’t growing around the mould, which secreted a chemical that inhibited bacterial growth. And apparently it has nothing to do with him seeing a mouldy piece of bread.</p>

<h3 id="laminated-glasshttpsenwikipediaorgwikilaminated_glass"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_glass">Laminated glass</a></h3>

<p>In 1903, Edouard Benedictus dropped a glass flask with a liquid plastic solution in it. The liquid evaporated, but the glass didn’t shatter, and maintained the shape of the container. With this discovery, he created laminated — or safety — glass, which is used in safety goggles and car windscreens.</p>

<h3 id="pacemakerhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiartificial_cardiac_pacemaker"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker">Pacemaker</a></h3>

<p>Wilson Greatbatch was building a device to record heart rhythm, and on pulling a resistor out of a box and fitting it, he found it was the wrong size, but the electrical pulses emitted by the circuit made him think of a  previous idea that electricity might stimulate the heart</p>

<h3 id="microwave-ovenhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimicrowave_oven"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven">Microwave oven</a></h3>

<p>This was discovered in 1945 by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Spencer">Percy Spencer</a>, and involved him pointing vacuum tubes at different things, after a chocolate bar melted in his pockets. The first microwave weighed 340kg, and the first desktop unit sold in 1965 for $500.</p>

<h3 id="quininehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiquinine"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine">Quinine</a></h3>

<p>Many know that quinine is used in tonic, which is in turn used in a gin-and-tonic. As Max points out, we used to put gin in tonic to make the tonic drinkable, whereas now we have nice-tasting gins.</p>

<h3 id="more-of-max-thomas">More of Max Thomas</h3>

<p>Max is part of Birmingham-based improv comedy troupe <a target="_blank" href="https://okstop.co.uk/">OK Stop!</a>, who you can see perform at 1000 Trades in the Jewellery Quarter on the last Wednesday of every month. You can also follow Max on Twitter @<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/maximum_science">maximum_science</a>.</p>

  <h4>Lucy Day</h4>
  <p>Comedy improviser and self-styled &#8220;failed jogger&#8221;</p>

<p>Improv comedian and self-styled “failed jogger” Lucy Day joins Mark to relive their childhoods and complain about the toys they never had.</p>

<p>Both Mark and Lucy wanted a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mr-Frosty-Crunchy-Ice-Maker/dp/B01BM60SBG">Mr Frosty</a> but were denied one, and were both fans of the wonderful book and TV series <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals_of_Farthing_Wood">The Animals of Farthing Wood</a>. Mark nearly tells a story about showing a family member his organ (it’s fine), and Lucy reveals the toys that made her anxious as a child, namely <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hasbro-HGA008-Crocodile-Dentist-Game/dp/B0009VTHJA">Crocodile Dentist</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Etch-A-Sketch-20083952-Classic/dp/B01N1ZVYDM/">Etch-a-Sketch</a>.</p>

<p>Trigger warning: if you ever put on a show for your parents and they told you they were watching, they weren’t. Sorry. Also, it turns out that growing up isn’t about not being able to do anything you want, but about being able to do anything you want, but having to face the consequences.</p>

<p>The pair also compare the dogs they had. You can be the decider as to which one is best.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-privilege">A note on privilege</h3>

<p>We all know that when Lucy says she had a &#8220;privileged&#8221; upbringing, she&#8217;s being a bit self-deprecating rather than elitist. You know this, but now it&#8217;s in print.</p>

<h3 id="honourable-mentions">Honourable mentions</h3>

<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meccano">Mechano</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Toys-Games-Sylvanian-Families/">Sylvanian Families</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_caps_(game)">Pogs</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hexbug.com/">Hex Bugs</a>, the battling robotic insects Mark was thinking of</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lucys-picks">Lucy’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h4 id="dressing-up-box">Dressing-up box</h4>

<p>Made with love and care by Mum, with some items donated by other family members — perhaps those no longer with us — the dressing-up box is one of many doors to a whole world of imagination.</p>

<h4 id="sega-megadrivehttpsenwikipediaorgwikisega_genesis"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis">Sega MegaDrive</a></h4>

<p>Americans mistakenly call it the “Genesis”, but to everyone who grew up in the 90s outside of North America, the Sega MegaDrive was a thing of 16-bit beauty.</p>

<h4 id="legohttpsenwikipediaorgwikihistory_of_lego"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lego">Lego</a></h4>

<p>Lucy played with what by today’s standards might be considered a paltry amount of bricks, but “back in our day”, they were simply what was on offer. And they were enough. Lucy used to build things with her dad, in a world before Marvel and Star Wars sets were everywhere (usually on the floor).</p>

<h4 id="sindyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikisindy"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindy">Sindy</a></h4>

<p>This “cheap woman’s Barbie” was not necessarily a feminist icon, but she was affordable. Back then it was all about the drama, and the necessary intermingling of characters from the Sindy universe and Sylvanian Families.</p>

<h4 id="spirographhttpsenwikipediaorgwikispirograph"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph">Spirograph</a></h4>

<p>Like Lucy’s life (apparently… we’re probably not best equipped to judge), the Spirograph showed great promise but was ultimately less-than-satisfying after a few goes.</p>

<h3 id="marks-picks">Mark’s picks</h3>

<p>In order of discussion:</p>

<h3 id="karaoke-machine-and-portable-tape-player">Karaoke machine and portable tape player</h3>

<p>Mark and his friend used to record secret missions with each-other, with the mission-setter using the karaoke machine to make an instructional tape the player would play, as he navigated the world his friend had created, fighting awkwardly.</p>

<h4 id="sega-game-gearhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigame_gear"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Gear">Sega Game Gear</a></h4>

<p>Mark saved up his own money to buy this handheld 8-bit console. It scored over the Game Boy as it was full-colour and had a landscape screen, but there weren’t enough original titles to keep it afloat. Very well-off boys and girls might have added the optional <a target="_blank" href="https://segaretro.org/TV_Tuner">TV tuner</a> so they could watch telly on a 3” screen.</p>

<h4 id="teddy-bear">Teddy bear</h4>

<p>Mark’s teddy was called Havy, for some reason. He was brown and had a little red heart on his chest. Mark loved him very much, but he probably had to go to where all teddy bears go after a while, when the stuffing can no longer be replaced.</p>

<h4 id="magna-doodlehttpsenwikipediaorgwikimagna_doodle"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Doodle">Magna Doodle</a></h4>

<p>Unlike the aforementioned Etch-a-Sketch, the Magna Doodle was a freeform drawing device that promised a lot more creative freedom. Apparently divers use it underwater — even though they’re absolutely not rated for that use — because the “ink” is based on magnetism, not gravity.</p>

<h4 id="train-set">Train set</h4>

<p>The video Mark was thinking of, with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkbwI74ht6s">Thomas doing stunts</a> doesn’t involve 50 Cent — that’s another one — but is an iteration on the Thomas the Dank Engine meme.</p>
