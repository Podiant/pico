Pico (as in "de gallo") is a project management tool for podcasters, created by Mark Steadman of [Radio Burrito](https://radioburrito.com/). It helps him manage his workload, but more importantly provides a place for clients to upload their audio and add notes to episodes.

## Requirements

To run in development mode, the project just requires Python 3.

## License

You're free to use the project for any purpose, including commercially, for free. If you modify the source, you need to contribute it back to the community, ideally by forking this repo. You can't make derivative works from Pico that are not open source.
